I created this straightforward starter project to get any CRUD-based Spring Boot application started.  
 There is no login, no security, and no complex reasoning involved.  
 Just a simple setup that you may expand upon when you need to quickly develop REST APIs.

 A clean Spring Boot project structure
- Perfect base for adding CRUD operations
- Ready for REST APIs
- Maven for dependency management
- DevTools for quick reloads
- Works with H2/MySQL (whatever you plug in)
